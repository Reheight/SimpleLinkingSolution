# SimpleLinkingSolution

This system was created as a learning opportunity and unfortunately I used some ineffective ways to update linking status' so we do not suggest you use this system. We recommend that for a curated system that can provide more stability you can check out [SteamCord](https://steamcord.io/) for a service that will host for you or you can use a system such as [SimpleLink](https://lone.design/product/simple-link-discord-steam-linking-system/) which will allow you to host the API seamlessly on your own Apache/Nginx/Web server.

# Developers
This system is in retrospect a working system. We have not provided a front-end as we never fully finished or published this project. You can of course use it for inspiration or to learn how you can achieve similar results in your own application. If you plan to fork this software, it's encouraged you undergo heavy modification to the way you update linking status'. We did include a copy of a barebones React website that uses short polling but this will easily eat up the Discord API rate limit.
